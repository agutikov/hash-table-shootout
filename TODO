    apps:
    counters
    sum repeats
    batch repeats


bench.py test run execution limit




batch tests with log n_items
avg cpu cycles and time
max op elapsed time
tests for avg/max op time on n_items map (fill, small batch, track time, get avg and max)
test option:
- number of maps
- preparation: fill, fill + delete random half, havily used (fill+delete multiple times, with timeout)
- operations: insert, delete, lookup existing, lookup missed, iterate, intersect, random ops
exponentiall fill 1000,10k,100k,1M,... and bench on every size
